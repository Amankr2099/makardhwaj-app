<p>
  Hospitals are crucial for patients, especially wheelchair users dealing
  with illnesses or post-surgery. However, most wheelchairs lack
  adjustability, pressure management, and adequate mobility support,
  leading to limited comfort and care.
  Wheelchair users are prone to complications like pressure ulcers, muscle
  atrophy, and mental health decline due to immobility. Assistive
  wheelchair technologies improve comfort, mobility, and patient recovery.

  Transferring wheelchair users often requires a support person, which can
  affect their dignity and lead to accidents or injuries during the
  transfer. Reducing height differences between platforms during transfers
  can help minimize risks and improve safety.
